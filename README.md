- 👋 Hi, I’m Konstantin.
- 👀 I’m interested in Frontend web development.
- 🏫 The techniques that I learned so far are HTML5, CSS3, SASS, PARCEL. I can use NPM and GIT. Looking ahead to study VUE. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Bootstrap, and continue to build my portfolio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate as a FE developer on some friendly sustainably developing team, distantly.
- 📫 I’m available via e-mail: konstantingrinev7@gmail.com.
